Notes: 
All of the construction scripts work. The original construction script is just random using the 
given blueprint nodes, the revised version works the same it just uses the assn4 plugin. The 
construction script with Mitchell's Best Candidate algorithm is similar to the revised one 
except it is no longer random. Since the mesh I used is bigger than the example I had to 
increase the size of the area that they are generated to make the results more obvious. 
The images below use the default seed of 0.
