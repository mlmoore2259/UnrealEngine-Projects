Notes: I tried to implement the three boid behavior rules found in the source below. I have the functions to implement them, but
in the video the actors only have simple physics. There is something wrong where my Tick() function wasn't being called and I couldn't 
figure out why. I had a log in the Tick() function, but it would never appear even if I made sure ticking was enabled in the constructor. 
I do have the neighborhood set and neighborhood tracking working as you can see in the output log.
